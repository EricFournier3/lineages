Lineage	Notes
A	Root of the pandemic lies within lineage A. Many sequences originating from China and many global exports; including to South East Asia, Japan, South Korea, Australia, the USA and Europe, represented in this lineage
A.1	A North American lineage, with some sequences from Australia in (BS=95)
A.1.1	Iceland lineage (BS:100->79)
*A.1.2	Reassigned to A.1 (low BS two weeks running)
A.1.3	Australian lineage (BS=100)
A.2	Spain/ Chile/ Australia/ Europe (BS=93)
A.3	USA and Australian lineage (BS: 100 -> 44). Low BS likely due to India/NCDC-3279/2020, which was misassigned and likely jumps around the tree.
A.4	Lineage circulating in USA (all sequences Wisconsin) (BS=100)
A.5	A lineage with a lot of representation from Spanish-speaking countries. A majoritively Spain/ South-American lineage, lower bootstrap this week BS 87->20. 
A.6	Lineage in Thailand (BS=87)
A.p7	Potential lineage: Saudi Arabia, Russia, Turkey, India (BS=50)
B	Base of this lineage also lies in China, with many global exports, two distinct SNPs `8782TC` and `28144CT` define this lineage
B.1	A large European lineage that corresponds to the Italian outbreak.
B.1.45	Australian lineage (more support this week BS=91), all Australian sequences within a background of European and Asian
B.1.49	Scotland (BS=92)
B.1.1	New European lineage that's been assigned due to high support and 3 clear SNPs `28881GA`,`28882GA`,`28883GC`. Note: Sub-lineages that previously existed within this lineage have been reassigned a new lineage name.
